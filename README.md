# Zuber-Web-Scrapping
## Purpose
Zuber is a new ride-sharing company that is launching in Chicago. We are tasked to find patterns in the available information. The goal of the project is to understand passenger passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Working with the database, we will analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency. 


## Conclusions
Hypothesis testing confirms weather plays a crucial role in determining the average ride duration from the Loop to O'hare International. Bad weather conditions change the average ride duration. The data shows that downtown areas are popular drop-off locations. The data also shows that more rides were observed on days when the weather was good. Overall, Zuber should incentivize their drivers to participate when the weather is good. We should also target areas that are within a 34 minute driving radius on a good day, and a 40 minute driving radius from downtown Chicago on a bad day.
